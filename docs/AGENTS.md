# Coucou — third-party agent integration

Any tool that can write to a Unix domain socket (macOS, Linux) or a named pipe (Windows) can send events to Coucou and have its own pill next to Claude Code.

## The `coucou_agent` field

Add the optional field `coucou_agent` to any hook JSON payload. Coucou will create a pill labelled with the agent name and route all events to it.

**Validation:** the name must match `^[a-z0-9-]{1,24}$` (lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, 1–24 characters). An absent or invalid name routes the event to the Claude Code pill instead.

## Hook command (macOS)

Configure your tool to call the Coucou relay with `--agent <your-name>` after the hook executable:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      { "type": "command", "command": "/path/to/nb-hook --agent my-tool" }
    ]
  }
}
```

The shell wrapper passes `"$@"` to the Python relay, which extracts the agent name and injects it into the payload before forwarding to Coucou.

## Hook command (Windows)

Same pattern with the Windows relay:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      { "type": "command", "command": "C:\\path\\to\\coucou-hook.exe --agent my-tool" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Hook command (Linux)

Same pattern with the Linux relay. Coucou copies the relay to `~/.local/share/coucou/bin/coucou-hook` at startup.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      { "type": "command", "command": "/path/to/coucou-hook --agent my-tool" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Payload format

The relay adds `coucou_agent` to the JSON it forwards. You can also add it yourself if you talk to the socket directly:

```json
{
  "hook_event_name": "UserPromptSubmit",
  "session_id": "my-session-1",
  "coucou_agent": "my-tool",
  "prompt": "Running task…"
}
```

Send newline-terminated JSON to the socket:
- **macOS (GitHub build):** `~/Library/Application Support/NotchBuddy/nb.sock`
- **macOS (App Store build):** `~/Library/Containers/fr.louisraille.Coucou/Data/nb.sock`
- **Windows:** `\\.\pipe\coucou-<user-SID>`
- **Linux:** `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/coucou.sock` (usually `/run/user/<uid>/coucou.sock`). Only your own user account can connect.

## Supported events

All standard Claude Code hook events are supported, **except `PermissionRequest`**
for relay-based agents: a `PermissionRequest` from an external relay agent is
answered immediately with `"ask"`, so the agent re-asks in its own terminal.
First-class agents — Codex and OpenCode (GitHub build only) — get the same notch
approval card as Claude Code and Cursor.

The pill lifecycle:

| Event | Effect |
|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | Creates the pill (if absent), sets state to idle |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | State → thinking; prompt shown in ticker |
| `PreToolUse` | State → working; tool label shown in ticker |
| `PostToolUse` / `PostToolUseFailure` | State → working |
| `Notification` | Rate-limit or question state if applicable |
| `Stop` | State → finished for 5 s; active declared pills (catalog + checked in Settings) reset to idle — all others are removed |
| `StopFailure` | State → error |
| `SessionEnd` | Active declared pills (catalog + checked in Settings) reset to idle — all others are removed |
| `SubagentStart` / `SubagentStop` | Step added to ticker |

## Declared pills

A **declared pill** is a catalog entry (`PillCatalog.swift`) that has been enabled in **Settings → Active pills**. When a session ends for a declared pill, the pill stays visible and resets to idle instead of disappearing.

A catalog pill that is not checked in Settings behaves like any other agent: it gets an automatic pill when a session starts, and that pill is removed when the session ends.

The GitHub build exposes Gemini CLI (`agent_gemini`), Antigravity (`agent_antigravity`) and OpenCode (`agent_opencode`, full session support via the bundled plugin) in Settings → Active pills. Cursor (`agent_cursor`) and Codex (`agent_codex`, GitHub build only) are there too — their pills can be declared and set as the main pill; session support is coming in a future version.

## Real-world examples

### Gemini CLI (macOS)

Coucou supports Gemini CLI out of the box via **Settings → Gemini CLI → Install hooks**.
The installer writes to `~/.gemini/settings.json` and uses `--agent gemini` so
Gemini sessions get their own pill. The relay translates Gemini event names to canonical
Coucou events automatically.

| Gemini CLI event | Canonical event |
|---|---|
| `BeforeTool` | `PreToolUse` |
| `AfterTool` | `PostToolUse` |
| `BeforeAgent` | `UserPromptSubmit` |
| `AfterAgent` | `Stop` |

`AfterModel` is not installed — it fires on every response chunk and would flood the island.

### Antigravity — `agy` (macOS)

Coucou supports Antigravity out of the box via **Settings → Antigravity → Install hooks**.
The installer writes to `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json` (timeouts in seconds) and uses
`--agent antigravity`. The relay translates `toolCall.name` / `conversationId` to the
island's `tool_name` / `session_id`.

| Antigravity event | Canonical event |
|---|---|
| `PreInvocation` | `UserPromptSubmit` |
| `PreToolUse` | `PreToolUse` |
| `PostToolUse` | `PostToolUse` |
| `PostInvocation` | `PostToolUse` |
| `Stop` | `Stop` |

### OpenCode (macOS, GitHub build)

Coucou supports OpenCode out of the box via **Settings → OpenCode Hooks → Install hooks**.
Unlike Gemini CLI and Antigravity, OpenCode uses a native **plugin** instead of the hook
relay: the installer writes a bundled OpenCode V2 plugin to
`~/.config/opencode/plugins/coucou/index.mjs` (OpenCode auto-loads anything under
`~/.config/opencode/plugins/`) and adds a `plugins` entry pointing to that file in
`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`. The plugin subscribes to OpenCode's event stream,
maps the events to Coucou's canonical shape, and pushes them to the socket with
`coucou_agent: "opencode"` — so OpenCode sessions get their own pill.

| OpenCode event (live v2 stream) | Canonical event |
|---|---|
| `session.execution.started` | `SessionStart` |
| `session.inbox.enqueued` | `UserPromptSubmit` |
| `session.tool.called` | `PreToolUse` |
| `session.tool.success` | `PostToolUse` |
| `session.tool.failed` | `PostToolUseFailure` |
| `session.execution.succeeded` | `Stop` |
| `session.execution.failed` | `StopFailure` |
| `session.deleted` | `SessionEnd` |

(`session.created` and `session.idle` are also mapped — they fire in
interactive TUI sessions.)

`permission.asked` is not a lifecycle event — the plugin relays permission requests to
the notch as an approval card; **Allow**, **Always** and **Deny** are returned to OpenCode
as `once`, `always` and `reject`.

The plugin fails soft: if the socket is unreachable (Coucou not running) it drops the
event, logs to OpenCode's output (throttled), and never blocks OpenCode. Each event is
sent on its own short-lived connection — Coucou closes every connection after a single
event, the same one-event-per-connection protocol as the hook relays — so if Coucou
starts while an OpenCode session is already running, the next event is picked up
automatically (no session restart needed).

### Any other tool

Follow the generic pattern: call `nb-hook --agent <your-name> <EventName>` (macOS),
`coucou-hook.exe --agent <your-name> <EventName>` (Windows)
or `~/.local/share/coucou/bin/coucou-hook --agent <your-name> <EventName>` (Linux)
and let the relay forward the event.

## Quick test (Linux)

With Coucou running:

```sh
echo '{"hook_event_name":"UserPromptSubmit","session_id":"t1","prompt":"hello","coucou_agent":"demo"}' \
  | ~/.local/share/coucou/bin/coucou-hook --agent demo
```

A "demo" pill should appear in the island.

## Quick test (macOS)

With Coucou running:

```sh
echo '{"hook_event_name":"UserPromptSubmit","session_id":"t1","prompt":"hello","coucou_agent":"demo"}' \
  | /bin/sh ~/Library/Application\ Support/NotchBuddy/nb-hook --agent demo
```

A "demo" pill should appear in the island.
